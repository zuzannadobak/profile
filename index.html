  <p>Hi, I am Zuzanna and I am almost a very junior programmer. As you can see, I love nature and stay close to mother earth. It helps me to be more and more grounded so my code will remain the same way: clean, precise and flex.

  <h2>My philosophy.</h2>
  <p>My philosophy is based on a belief in the unity and purposefulness of the Universe. Where we, regardless of gender, age and background have tasks to complete. The completion of these tasks leads us to unity with the Universe.
    The conditions for discovering these tasks are harmony, skilful listening to oneself, and therefore unity of body, mind and spirit. Only when we have an equally important and audible voice, can we feel at peace in the here and now. Therefore, the most important aspects of my work are the levels of body, mind, spirit and intellect.

  <h2>The code of conduct of being a programmer.</h2>
  <p>With support of my intellect in harmony with other elements and according to "the programmer's oath": I will not produce harmful code.
  The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
  I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
